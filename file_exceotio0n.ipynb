        "### 1. **Scenarios where Multithreading is Preferable to Multiprocessing and Vice Versa**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multithreading is preferable** when:\n",
        "  - The task is I/O-bound (e.g., reading/writing files, waiting for network responses).\n",
        "  - The task requires shared memory or data structures to be accessed and modified by multiple threads.\n",
        "  - There's limited CPU time needed, and you want to save memory, as threads share the same memory space.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multiprocessing is preferable** when:\n",
        "  - The task is CPU-bound (e.g., performing mathematical calculations, image/video processing).\n",
        "  - You want to run truly parallel tasks because each process runs in its own memory space.\n",
        "  - Tasks may cause deadlocks or race conditions with shared memory, which is easier to manage in multiprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **What is a Process Pool?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A **process pool** is a mechanism to manage a group of worker processes that can be reused to perform multiple tasks concurrently. Instead of creating a new process for each task, the pool maintains a limited number of processes and assigns tasks to them as they become available.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "- Efficient management of resources: Reduces the overhead of creating and destroying processes.\n",
        "- Load balancing: Tasks can be assigned dynamically based on availability, helping distribute workload evenly.\n",

        "### 3. **What is Multiprocessing and Why is it Used in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multiprocessing** is a module in Python that allows a program to create multiple processes, each running independently in its own memory space. It is particularly useful for parallelizing tasks across multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is it used?**\n",
        "- To overcome the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python that restricts the execution of multiple threads in parallel. With multiprocessing, each process runs in its own interpreter and avoids this limitation.\n",
