        "Non-Negativity: The F-distribution is defined only for non-negative values, as it involves the ratio of squared variances.\n",

        "The F-distribution is used in:\n",
        "\n",
        "Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): To test for differences in means across multiple groups.\n",
        "F-tests for Equality of Variances: To compare the variances of two populations.\n",

        "Purpose of ANOVA: ANOVA tests whether there are statistically significant differences in the means of three or more groups.\n",
        "Difference from a t-test: A t-test compares the means of two groups, whereas ANOVA is used for comparing more than two groups simultaneously.\n",
        "5. Why Use One-Way ANOVA Instead of Multiple t-Tests\n",
        "Efficiency: One-way ANOVA performs a single test instead of multiple pairwise t-tests.\n",

        "Within-group Variance: Reflects variability within individual groups.\n",
        "Contribution to F-statistic: The F-statistic is calculated as the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance. A larger F-statistic suggests more significant group differences.\n",
