How are they denoted?\\nans.In Python, there are three types of access modifiers used to define the visibility and accessibility of class attributes and methods. Although Python does not have strict access control like some other languages (e.g., `private`, `protected`, and `public` in Java), it uses a naming convention to indicate the intended access level. These access modifiers are:\\n\\n### 1. **Public**\\n- **Denoted By**: Attributes and methods are public by default and can be accessed from inside or outside the class.\\n- **Notation**: No leading underscores.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```python\\nclass MyClass:\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.public_var = \"I am a public variable\"\\n    \\n    def public_method(self):\\n        print(\"I am a public method\")\\n\\nobj = MyClass()\\nprint(obj.public_var)  # Output: I am a public variable\\nobj.public_method()    # Output: I am a public method\\n```\\n\\n### 2. **Protected**\\n- **Denoted By**: A single leading underscore `_` before the attribute or method name.\\n- **Purpose**: Indicates that the attribute or method is intended for internal use only and should not be accessed directly from outside the class. However, this is just a convention and not enforced by the Python language.\\n- **Notation**: `_protected_var`\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```python\\nclass MyClass:\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self._protected_var = \"I am a protected variable\"\\n    \\n    def _protected_method(self):\\n        print(\"I am a protected method\")\\n\\nobj = MyClass()\\nprint(obj._protected_var)  # Output: I am a protected variable\\nobj._protected_method()    # Output: I am a protected method\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, `_protected_var` and `_protected_method()` are intended to be used within the class or its subclasses, but they can still be accessed from outside if needed.\\n\\n### 3. **Private**\\n- **Denoted By**: A double leading underscore `__` before the attribute or method name.\\n- **Purpose**: Used to restrict access to class attributes and methods from outside the class. Python performs name mangling, which changes the name of the attribute in a way that makes it harder to access directly.\\n- **Notation**: `__private_var`\\n\\n**Example:**\\n```python\\nclass MyClass:\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.__private_var = \"I am a private variable\"\\n    \\n    def __private_method(self):\\n        print(\"I am a private method\")\\n\\nobj = MyClass()\\n# The following lines would raise an AttributeError\\n# print(obj.__private_var)  \\n# obj.__private_method()\\n\\n# Accessing the private members using name mangling\\nprint(obj._MyClass__private_var)  # Output: I am a private variable\\nobj._MyClass__private_method()    # Output: I am a private method\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, `__private_var` and `__private_method()` are private members.

New balance is: {self.__balance}\")\\n        else:\\n            print(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\")\\n\\n    # Method to withdraw money\\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\\n        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:\\n            self.__balance -= amount\\n            print(f\"Withdrew {amount}. New balance is: {self.__balance}\")\\n        elif amount > self.__balance:\\n            print(\"Insufficient balance.\")\\n        else:\\n            print(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\")\\n\\n    # Method to inquire the balance\\n    def get_balance(self):\\n        return f\"The current balance is: {self.__balance}\"\\n\\n    # Method to get account number (read-only)\\n    def get_account_number(self):\\n        return f\"Account Number: {self.__account_number}\"\\n\\n# Creating a BankAccount object\\naccount = BankAccount(\"123456789\", 1000)\\n\\n# Accessing the methods\\nprint(account.get_account_number())  # Output: Account Number: 123456789\\nprint(account.get_balance())         # Output: The current balance is: 1000\\n\\n# Depositing money\\naccount.deposit(500)                 # Output: Deposited 500. New balance is: 1500\\n\\n# Withdrawing money\\naccount.withdraw(200)                # Output: Withdrew 200. New balance is: 1300\\n\\n# Checking balance again\\nprint(account.get_balance())         # Output: The current balance is: 1300\\n\\n# Attempting to directly access private attributes (will fail)\\n# print(account.__balance)           # AttributeError\\n# print(account.__account_number)    # AttributeError\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n1. **Private Attributes (`__balance` and `__account_number`)**:\\n   - The attributes `__balance` and `__account_number` are private, indicated by double underscores (`__`).\\n   - These attributes cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Attempting to do so will raise an `AttributeError`.\\n\\n2. **Public Methods for Access and Modification**:\\n   - `deposit(amount)`: Adds the specified amount to the `__balance` if the amount is positive.\\n   - `withdraw(amount)`: Subtracts the specified amount from the `__balance` if it is positive and there are sufficient funds.\\n   - `get_balance()`: Returns the current balance.\\n   - `get_account_number()`: Returns the account number. This method provides read-only access to the account number.\\n\\n3. **Encapsulation in Action**:\\n   - Private attributes ensure that the `balance` and `account_number` can only be accessed and modified through the provided methods.\\n   - This protects the integrity of the data and enforces rules (e.g., non-negative deposits and withdrawals).\\n\\n### Summary\\nThis example demonstrates encapsulation by protecting the internal state of the `BankAccount` object. Users can interact with the `balance` and `account_number` only through the provided methods, ensuring controlled access and modification.\\n'"

              "'\\nxii.Explain the concept of the Diamond Problem in multiple inheritance. How does Python resolve it?\\nans.The **Diamond Problem** is a well-known issue in object-oriented programming that occurs when a class inherits from two classes that both derive from a single base class. This creates an ambiguity in the method resolution order (MRO) because the subclass has two paths to the base class.\\n\\n### Understanding the Diamond Problem\\n\\nLet\\'s visualize the problem with an example:\\n\\n```\\n     A\\n   /     B     C\\n   \\\\   /\\n     D\\n```\\n\\n- **Class `A`**: The top base class.\\n- **Classes `B` and `C`**: Both inherit from `A`.\\n- **Class `D`**: Inherits from both `B` and `C`.\\n\\nIn this structure:\\n- `D` has two potential paths to reach `A`: `D -> B -> A` and `D -> C -> A`.\\n- If `A` has a method called `some_method()`, and `D` calls `some_method()`, it\\'s unclear whether Python should call `A`\\'s implementation through `B` or through `C`. This is the essence of the diamond problem: **ambiguity in method resolution**.\\n\\n### Python\\'s Resolution: C3 Linearization (Method Resolution Order - MRO)\\n\\nPython resolves the Diamond Problem using a specific algorithm called **C3 Linearization**. This algorithm ensures a consistent and predictable order for method resolution, following these rules:\\n\\n1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Python first performs a DFS to create a linear order of classes.\\n2. **Left-to-Right Ordering**: When resolving methods, the leftmost base class is considered first, following the order of inheritance defined in the class declaration.\\n3. **Avoiding Repetition**: The method from a base class is called only once, even if there are multiple paths to it.\\n\\nPython computes the MRO in such a way that it respects the hierarchy and prevents calling the same method multiple times due to multiple inheritance paths.\\n\\n### Example: Diamond Problem in Python\\n\\n```python\\nclass A:\\n    def show(self):\\n        print(\"Method from class A\")\\n\\nclass B(A):\\n    def show(self):\\n        print(\"Method from class B\")\\n        \\nclass C(A):\\n    def show(self):\\n        print(\"Method from class C\")\\n        \\nclass D(B, C):\\n    pass\\n\\nd = D()\\nd.show()\\n```\\n\\n### Output:\\n```\\nMethod from class B\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n\\n1. **MRO Calculation**:\\n   - For class `D`, the MRO is calculated as `[D, B, C, A, object]`.\\n   - This means that Python will look for the `show()` method in `D` first, then in `B`, then in `C`, and finally in `A`.\\n\\n2. **Resolution**:\\n   - When `d.show()` is called, Python follows the MRO and finds the `show()` method in class `B` first, so it calls `B`\\'s implementation.\\n   - If `B` did not have a `show()` method, Python would continue to `C`, then to `A`.\\n\\n3. **Preventing Ambiguity**:\\n   - The MRO ensures that there\\'s no ambiguity even in complex inheritance structures, as it provides a deterministic order in which classes are searched.\\n\\n### How to View the MRO:\\n\\nYou can view the MRO of a class using the `mro()` method or the `__mro__` attribute:\\n\\n```python\\nprint(D.mro())  # Output: [<class \\'__main__.D\\'>, <class \\'__main__.B\\'>, <class \\'__main__.C\\'>, <class \\'__main__.A\\'>, <class \\'object\\'>]\\nprint(D.__mro__)  # Output: (<class \\'__main__.D\\'>, <class \\'__main__.B\\'>, <class \\'__main__.C\\'>, <class \\'__main__.A\\'>, <class \\'object\\'>)\\n```\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\n- **Diamond Problem**: Occurs in multiple inheritance when there is ambiguity in which method to call due to a class having multiple paths to a base class.\\n- **Python\\'s Solution**: Uses the C3 Linearization algorithm to compute a consistent MRO that respects the hierarchy and prevents ambiguity.\\n- **MRO**: Defines the order in which classes are searched for methods and attributes, ensuring that the diamond problem is resolved correctly.\\n'"
